          I specialize in full-stack development, creating and integrating
          data-driven applications with effective interfaces to deliver dynamic
          user experiences. I also enjoy coding as a hobby, allowing me to
          explore new technologies and push the boundaries of what's possible.
          When I'm not coding, you can usually find me playing badminton or
          watching cricket. Trying to be a better version of myself every day in
          this fast moving world.
